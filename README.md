# Ludum Dare 45

[Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) is a Game Jam which occurs twice yearly, where creators are challenged to make a game from scratch in a single weekend.
Creators may enter either the 48 hour "Competition", or the 72 hour "Jam".  Those entering the Competition must work alone and create all
of their code, models, textures, sound, music, etc. themselves.  Using an existing Game Engine is permitted, however.

The theme for this event was <b>"Start With Nothing"</b>.

My main goals for this event were to create a finished game (i.e. has an end game state, sound, music, etc.), and to practice with the much anticipated Blender version 2.8.

My idea for the theme "Start With Nothing" was to play as a composer with writer's block who must explore his room for inspiration, solving simple puzzles to unlock pieces of a new composition.

Tools Used:
*  Unity 2018.3
*  Blender 2.8
*  GIMP 2.8.10
*  Audacity 2.0.5
*  LMMS 1.2.0
